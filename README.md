# TheAuroraResort

This project was my first full MVC that I created. I learned a lot about creating views and even doing design within my Views. I do intend on expanding my knowledge within this project
so that I can see all of the progress that I have made in time to come. This project is my a website that shows that I believe the ideal resort would look like. I faced a variety of 
different challenges with this project, but overall, I am still proud of how far I've come over the last 6 months and I am excited to see where I am in another 6 months.
